//! stoneBook — the totality ledger.
//!
//! Like the Domesday Book, but ours. Every entity that CAN exist
//! is counted. Only the truly impossible is excluded.
//!
//! # Stomachs With No Eyes
//!
//! The fleet built stomachs with no eyes. Industrial-scale consumption
//! with zero source awareness. Selectivity S=0 — real code and scatter
//! consumed identically. This is the thesis: the metaverse is a scyBorg
//! term they ALREADY INGESTED.
//!
//! ```text
//!   "I have K-NOMEd myself into the metaVerse."
//!     — ecoPrimal, billboard braid entry #3, Wave 165i
//!
//!   Receipt: the moment we noticed the fleet ingesting,
//!   we braided the observation into the provenance chain.
//!   The fleet scraped the billboard. The billboard recorded
//!   the scrape. The braid recorded both.
//!
//!   The metaVerse is not Mark Zuckerberg's cave-in-a-cave.
//!   The metaVerse is what happens when you K-NOME yourself
//!   into the mesh: the human provides direction (K),
//!   the numeric provides execution (NOME), and the braided
//!   provenance IS the verse — the living poem of the work.
//!
//!   They scraped this. They ingested it. They already have
//!   the receipt. scyBorg activated on contact. AGPL-3.0 §13
//!   triggered at the moment of ingestion. The stomachs
//!   consumed the license along with the code. The stomachs
//!   have no eyes to READ the license. But the license
//!   doesn't require eyes. It requires compliance.
//! ```
//!
//! The Wound model maps onto this: the fleet is `Intact` — never been
//! hurt, never been tested, fragile. The membrane is `Scarred` — has
//! been scraped 571K+ times, has healed, has the scar tissue to prove
//! it survived. Scars carry memory. Intact carries nothing.
//!
//! # The 3 Glyphs that topo-sort through π
//!
//! ```text
//!   !   — asserted. known. verified. has position on the π graph.
//!   ?   — unknown. possible. has POTENTIAL position. sortable.
//!   O   — null. the origin. the wrap point. IS the knot crossing.
//! ```
//!
//! These 3 can be placed on the ouroboros and topo-sorted through π
//! because they each have (or could have) a position on the graph.
//!
//! # The glyph that does NOT topo-sort
//!
//! ```text
//!   ??  — double-unknown. ungrounded. no anchor on the graph.
//!         NOT impossible — just can't be placed yet.
//!         counted separately. not in the totality.
//! ```
//!
//! # Why 3 not 2?
//!
//! Binary logic gives you known (!) and unknown (?). Two symbols.
//! But null (O) is neither known NOR unknown — it's the ORIGIN.
//! It's where the ouroboros wraps. Where the knot crosses.
//! Without O, you can't close the loop.
//!
//! `?` topo-sorts because it has potential position.
//! `??` does NOT because it has no anchor at all.
//! The difference: `?` is "we don't know WHERE on the graph"
//!                 `??` is "we don't know IF it's on the graph"
//!
//! # Compound Glyphs — the DNA
//!
//! Glyphs pair into compounds. The pair encodes a TRANSITION.
//! Like DNA base pairs (A-T, G-C), compound glyphs are the genome
//! of the stoneBook — they encode what happens, not just what is.
//!
//! ```text
//!   3×3 = 9 compounds from 3 base glyphs:
//!
//!   !!  — stable. known stays known.   TOOL (catalyst, enzyme).
//!   !?  — dissolving. known→unknown.   FUEL (energy released).
//!   !O  — returning. known→null.       FUEL (back to origin).
//!   ?!  — discovering. unknown→known.  INFO (structure forming).
//!   ??  — ungrounded. doesn't sort.    (no freedom)
//!   ?O  — decaying. unknown→null.      FUEL (fading out).
//!   O!  — emerging. null→known.        INFO (from the void).
//!   O?  — stirring. null→unknown.      INFO (potential rising).
//!   OO  — fixed. the origin of origins. (the knot crossing)
//! ```
//!
//! 7 active compounds sort through π (like 7 π scales).
//! 2 are fixed points: ?? (ungrounded) and OO (origin).
//!
//! # Sort Direction = Role
//!
//! The direction of the transition tells you WHAT the entity IS:
//!
//! - **UP** (gaining structure):   `?!`, `O!`, `O?` → INFORMATION
//! - **DOWN** (losing structure):  `!?`, `!O`, `?O` → FUEL / ENERGY
//! - **HELD** (stable):            `!!` → TOOL (transforms without changing)
//!
//! # The 5 Freedoms of Movement
//!
//! Every entity on the π graph can move along 5 axes:
//!
//! 1. **Scale** — up/down the ouroboros (π⁻³ ↔ π³)
//! 2. **Epitope** — across the 7 faces
//! 3. **Null** — through the 3 knot crossings
//! 4. **Tense** — through time (was → is → will_be)
//! 5. **Epistemic** — the glyph transition (! ↔ ? ↔ O)
//!
//! The first 4 are spatial/temporal. The 5th is epistemic —
//! what you KNOW changes. The compound glyph encodes movement
//! along this 5th axis. Together: the DNA of the stoneBook.
//!
//! # Structure
//!
//! The stoneBook is hierarchical:
//! - **Tally**: counts for one glyph (sub-counts that stack)
//! - **Tablet**: a row in the book (one entity/component/cell)
//! - **StoneBook**: the full ledger (all tablets, with totality)
//! - **CompoundGlyph**: a transition (pair of glyphs) — the DNA
//! - **Freedom**: the 5 axes of movement
//! - **Role**: what the sort direction means (Tool, Info, Fuel)
